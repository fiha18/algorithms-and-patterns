**To solve this problem of generating all subsets of a given list using recursion, we use an approach called input-output method. In this method, the main idea is to divide the problem into smaller subproblems and explore two main choices at each step: including or excluding an element.**

**Let's walk through this approach with a recursion tree, using the input [1, 2, 3].**

**Problem Breakdown**

* **Input:** A list of numbers, `nums`, where we want to find all possible subsets.
* **Output:** A list of lists, where each inner list represents a subset of `nums`.

**Recursive Approach with Input-Output Method**

**Base Condition:**

* If the input list is empty, we add the current subset (`op`) to the `result` list and return.

**Choices:**

1. **Include the current element in the subset:**
   - Take the last element from the input list.
   - Add this element to the current `op` list.
   - Recursively call the function with the remaining elements in the input list.
2. **Exclude the current element from the subset:**
   - Remove the last element from the current `op` list.
   - Recursively call the function with the same input list.

**Backtracking:**
- After each recursive call, we backtrack to restore the input list and output list to their previous state, allowing us to explore other possibilities. Very important step other wise result will be like this.
```
Input
nums =
[1,2,3]
Output
[[3,2,1],[3,2],[3],[]]
Expected
[[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]
```

### Recursion Tree Explanation

Each level represents a choice for an element from the input list. Here’s the detailed breakdown:

In Image it is first excluded then included but , in code we first include then exclude
1. **Root**: Start with `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, `op = []`.
- Two choices for the element `3`: include it or exclude it.

2. **Level 1**:
- **Left Branch (Include `3`)**: `ip = [1, 2]`, `op = [3]`.
- **Right Branch (Exclude `3`)**: `ip = [1, 2]`, `op = []`.

3. **Level 2**:
- From the left branch with `op = [3]`:
  - **Include `2`**: `ip = [1]`, `op = [3, 2]`.
  - **Exclude `2`**: `ip = [1]`, `op = [3]`.
- From the right branch with `op = []`:
  - **Include `2`**: `ip = [1]`, `op = [2]`.
  - **Exclude `2`**: `ip = [1]`, `op = []`.

4. **Level 3**:
- Process each branch for the last element, `1`, similarly by including and excluding it.

5. **Leaf Nodes**: Each leaf node represents a complete subset. The result will contain all subsets once the recursion finishes.

### Final Result
Following this approach, the subsets generated are:
- `[3, 2, 1]`, `[3, 2]`, `[3, 1]`, `[3]`, `[2, 1]`, `[2]`, `[1]`, `[]`.

### Code Explanation with Comments

Here’s the code with detailed comments:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
 // Recursive function to generate all subsets
 void solve(vector<int>& ip, vector<int>& op, vector<vector<int>>& result) {
     // Base condition: if input list is empty, add the current subset (op) to result
     if (ip.size() == 0) {
         result.push_back(op);
         return;
     }
     
     // Choose the last element from the input list
     int first = ip[ip.size() - 1];
     
     // Include the current element in the subset
     op.push_back(first);
     ip.pop_back(); // Remove the chosen element from input
     
     // Recursive call with element included in the subset
     solve(ip, op, result);
     
     // Backtrack: remove the current element from output
     op.pop_back();
     
     // Recursive call without the current element included in the subset
     solve(ip, op, result);
     
     // Restore the input list (backtrack step)
     ip.push_back(first);
 }

public:
 // Main function to return all subsets of the input list
 vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums) {
     vector<vector<int>> result;  // To store all subsets
     vector<int> op;              // Current subset being built
     solve(nums, op, result);     // Call the recursive function
     return result;
 }
};
